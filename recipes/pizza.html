    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza is a popular Italian dish consisting of a flat,
        baked bread dough base topped with tomato sauce, 
        cheese, and other ingredients like meat, vegetables, and herbs. 
        It originated in Naples in the 19th century and is known for its quick, 
        high-temperature baking, often in a wood-fired oven, 
        resulting in a hot, delicious pie.
