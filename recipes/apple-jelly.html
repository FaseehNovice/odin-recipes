    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 pounds <strong>cooking apples</strong> such as Braeburn, Granny Smith,
        and/ or Rome Beauty</li>
        <li>3 cups <strong>water</strong></li>
        <li>1 cup <strong>apple juice</strong>, or up to 2 cups as needed</li>
        <li>1 (1.75 ounce) package regular <strong>powdered fruit pectin</strong> or 6 tablespoons classic powdered fruit pectin</li>
        <li>7 1/2 cups <strong>white sugar</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove stems and blossom ends from apples. 
            Do not peel or core (peels and cores contain pectin and will be discarded later). 
            Chop apples.</li>
        <li>Combine apples and the water in a large pot. Bring to a boil over high heat. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, covered, 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Place a colander lined with cheesecloth in a large bowl. Pour apple mixture into colander. Let drain, without pressing, until mixture stops dripping, 1 to 2 hours. 
            Add enough apple juice to juice in bowl to reach 5 cups. (Discard solids.)</li>
        <li>Return juice to clean large pot. Whisk in pectin. Bring to a full rolling boil. Add sugar. Return to a full rolling boil. Boil hard 1 minute. 
            If foam forms on surface, quickly glide a metal spoon over surface to skim off foam; discard.</li>
        <li>Ladle into 10 sterilized half-pint jars, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Wipe jar rims; adjust lids and bands.</li>
        <li>Place filled jars in a boiling water canner, 
            with enough water to cover jars by 1 inch. 
            Process for 5 minutes (start timing when water returns to a boil). 
            Remove jars from canner. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
